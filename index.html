							Doctors told their patients to get their affairs in order for an HIV positive status meant they likely wouldn’t live much past the age of 35.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 1995 alone, nearly 70,000 people were diagnosed with HIV in the United States. In that same year, 58,786 people died from the virus, according to the CDC. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The death rate has been down for over a decade and poz people have learned to manage the disease thanks to the introduction the HIV drug cocktail in late 1995 and 1996. Today approximately 13,000 people die in the United States from HIV a year. But the rate of infection in young gay males has not slowed. In fact, it’s growing.

							According to the CDC, the number of new infections in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the youngest age bracket (13-24) increased by 22 percent from 2008 to 2010. This year, the center reported that the rate is still climbing.

						</p>
						<p>
							But despite this unsettling trend, young gay and bisexual men are getting tested for the virus less frequently. A 2014 study from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that gay and bisexual men below the age of 35 are more twice as likely to have ever been tested for HIV, with 44 percent claiming to have never been tested.  Since the epidemic in the late 80s and 90s, the CDC has urged at least annual HIV testing for this population.
						</p>
						<p>
							The FDA approved a pre exposure prophylaxis drug, commonly known as PrEP, in 2012 that that is proven to be more that 90 percent effective in preventing the contraction of HIV through sex when taken daily. According to activists, not a single person has yet to have been reported contracting HIV while taking the drug properly.  However, the CDC and the pharmaceutical company that produces the drug, Gilead, said that less that 10,000 people in the United States are taking take PrEP. The CDC estimated that more than half a million people are eligible for the drug, 275,000 of them being uninfected gay men.
						</p>

						<p>
							Beyond the numbers and the studies, members in Chicago’s gay community agree that the perception of what it means to have and be aware of HIV has shifted entirely. What once manifested itself as life altering fear is now seen as low risk and manageable fact of life. 
						</p>

	<!--01 JEFF POWERS-->
						<h1> Jeff Powers (need to change name)</h1>
						<p class="lead">
							Jeff has lived with the fear of what was first introduced to him as the “gay cancer” since he was a teenager growing up in a rural Ohio town. He fell in love with wide-eyed, spontaneous man named Don in Chicago during the height of the AIDS epidemic. Don was HIV positive. Twenty-three years since they were first introduced, Jeff, now 50,  talked with us about the role HIV has played in his and his loved ones’ lives. 
						</p>
						<p>
							“We lived in Avondale in a two flat. The house was on Whipple Street and Addison. We could see the Target from our living room. His parents lived in the apartment below us. Don and I lived upstairs. We had a dog, Charlie. He was a Brittany Spaniel. He lived upstairs and downstairs… Christmas time, we would have an open house every Christmas Eve. Their whole family would come and they would be downstairs and all our friends would come and they would be upstairs, so it was just a house full of people on Christmas Eve. It was just fun.

						</p>
						<p>
							I haven’t celebrated Christmas since he died. Because I just can’t do it any more because it’s just too sad. It still makes me sad. He died on December 29th, he had his aneurism on the 18th. I spent Christmas Eve in the hospital. It was terrible. Those 10 days were maybe the worst 10 days of my life...
						</p>
						
						<p class="lead">
							Don had a genetic mutation that created a third artery in his frontal cortex. The steroidal medication he was taking at the time for his disease was slowly eroding the walls of this artery. In 2002 he suffered a massive aneurism. 
						</p>

						<p>
							He worked at Swedish Covenant Hospital. It actually happened at work. It was just so weird how it happened. I remember I kissed him goodbye and I left for work. I was working at the Hancock building at the time…
						</p>

						<p>
							It was December and it was cold.I was in a cab and I was riding to the hospital. I remember sitting in the cab like this (looking off into the distance, his hand supporting his chi, his fingers draped across his lips) and thinking “this is it. Maybe it’s not it. No something happened and this is it.” I got to the hospital and I knew everybody there. Don was the kinda person that if you knew him you knew everything about him. You would meet him and within 10 minutes you would know his family and you would be having dinner with him that night with everyone else. He was just really gregarious and he had a gigantic group of friends. So when I got to the hospital I knew right where to go and exactly who to talk to. They brought me in to the room where he was and I just fainted. I became hysterical and I fainted…
						</p>
						<p>
							I just remember waking up on that floor after I fainted and Mary Kay looking at me like “Jeff you have to pull it together.” And I remember thinking, “Why do I have to pull it together? Why? Why did I have to get tested for HIV every six months? Why did I have to be afraid my whole life? Why do I have to do this? Why do I have to do everything?” The first word that came out of my mouth was “why.” And that’s when she got into “Because you’re the only one who can.” That’s what stuck with me. That’s what got me through, because it was the worst that ever happened to me. There’s nothing worse than meeting the person that is your soul mate and then they die. It wasn’t even 10 years yet. He was 39.
						</p>
						<p>
							The year immediately following that I would just come home and cry. It’s all I did. Every day. For a year. I remember I would be in one of the crying jives and thinking “are you ever going to stop doing this?” But I couldn’t stop...
						</p>
						<p>
							There was a day that I got through the entire day and realized I hadn’t but I don’t think that was the first day. I think it was just a day. I remember falling asleep and I realized I had made it a couple of days now where I didn’t cry at all. And I remember feeling a little guilty about it. It was something I had been doing for a year. Was I done mourning now? Is that what that means? I was just done with that part of it. The mourning process took a long time. It took years… he’s still with me today. He’ll never leave me.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							Several years after Don died, Jeff started dating again.
						</p>
						<p>
							I dated a lot of young guys… a lot of them wanted to have unprotected sex and this was back in 2003- 2004. It wasn’t where it is today. It was better, but we didn’t have PrEp then.… We would have unprotected sex but it was always a question we’d ask. And we always used condoms. There was never a question. You always had condoms with you. That was never even a question. It just was something that you did.
						</p>
						<p>
							There was a kid that I met online. He was 25 at the time, so he is probably in his 30’s now. And he was specifically looking for somebody to fuck him without a condom. And he actively pursued me. I wanted to meet him because I wanted to talk him out of it…
						</p>
						<p>
							The more that we had this conversation about “I just want to try,” the more it became clear that he didn’t just want to try it, he was participating in this risky behavior, because it was a thrill for him, it got him excited. It was something that he wanted to do because it was dangerous. And I didn’t sleep with him because I just couldn’t do it. It felt just gross to me. And I don’t think I could have because I was so turned off by that sort of unwillingness to see what he was doing to himself or what could potentially happen to him…
						</p>
						<p>
							It made me think about all my friends who died and it made me think about Don and it made me think about living with HIV, living with this specter of HIV in your life and just how draining it was and how terrifying it was, and how you live in fear all the time if you’re negative, and if you’re positive you’re not living in fear any more you’re just living with this disease. It really just made me sad.”

	<!--02 EDDIE GAMBOA-->
						<h1> Eddie Gamboa </h1>
						<p class="lead">
							Eddie is a 25-year-old graduate student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois and takes PrEP. He thinks contracting HIV is a risk people have the choice to take.
						</p>
						<p>
							“The first time I had sex with a condom was with a guy that I just hooked up with. He was one of my first sexual partners after my monogamous relationship ended in college, so I was 21 at the time… We met on Grindr and it was really the first time I had met someone on Grindr and decided to meet up with them. He was insistent that we use a condom, partly because he was older than I was. For him using a condom wasn’t a choice, it was something that you had to do to protect yourself, and for me it was a choice.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the same time I was in a class called the Rhetoric of HIV and AIDS that was all about the history of HIV, the history of safer sex campaigns, all of this sort of thing. I still remember the moment where he pulled out a condom and started to put it on and I felt like the entire class was watching me. I felt like the class was in my hotel room judging me for the decisions I was making, judging me for the way that I was engaging in this sexual practice and also judging me for the ways the condom went on. I had the overwhelming sense of dread that I was doing this wrong.
						</p>
						<p>
							When it was over and I had time to think about it, I was like “I was afraid for nothing.” This was just kind of an added bonus to the sexual experience but it didn’t take away from it and it didn't add anything to it, it was just something that happened. It was just a decision I was making to use a condom this time. It wasn’t something that I had to imbue with like a radical political decision, like “Oh, I’m stopping the spread of AIDS with this act. With this act I protect myself and future generations and I bring about this AIDS free generation we are always dreaming about.”
						</p>	
						<p>
							Since then I have viewed a lot of my sexual decisions as just that, as choices I am making. So my decision to go on PrEP was a decision that I made so that I could mediate certain factors in my life.
						</p>	
						<p>
							One of the reasons I’m on PrEP is because my partner is HIV positive. And sure, while he is on medications that decreases the chances that he will infect me, I decided to go on PrEP just so that I know that I have some reassurances on my side of the table as well. Because being in a serodiscordant relationship you kind of have to negotiate what are the risks involved very time we have sex. We have been together for almost 3 years now. I started PrEP about a year and a half ago, pretty much as soon as I got to Northwestern and my insurance would cover it...
						</p>
						<p>
							When I found out he was HIV positive, it didn’t shake me at all. It just meant that we had to have a discussion about the way that we were having sex and we had to have a discussion about what we were going to do as a result of it in order to ensure that I wasn’t infected, because I think that was a goal for the both of us, that we could minimize the risk as much as possible.
						</p>	
						<p>
							It’s not the only goal that we have when we have sex. A lot of that comes down from him. He knows what being HIV positive is like and he doesn't want me to go through those same experiences. As someone who is not HIV positive, I’m going to trust someone who is to tell me that I don’t want to do that...But at the same time, and I have been really honest with him about this. If I were to be infected it would not be the end of my world. While it remains a goal, it’s not like the ultimate prize where we get to the finish line of our life and we’re like “well I stayed negative this whole time” (he pumps his fist) Because I understand the risks involved. I understand that first of all I’m in a very privileged position here that provided me with health insurance that even if I were infected I would be taken care of, that I can live easy in the knowledge that I live in the time that these pills, though expensive, are available to me.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’m not saying that I’m looking to be infected but if I was infected, my whole life wouldn’t come crashing down around me, which is a very comforting thought because I know that if I lived 20 years ago I would be able to say something like that. And I acknowledge that as a site of privilege for myself and I celebrate that privilege as an indication of progress...
						</p>
						<p>
							People often say we’re not afraid of HIV and it’s something that is really frustrating to me. I don’t think HIV is at the forefront of people’s minds in the same way that it was at the apex of the epidemic in the United States, and part of that is because we don’t see people dying in the same way that they were in the 80s and early 90s, it’s just different, we have categorized HIV as a condition that you can live with for a very long time… Wasn’t this the goal of the 80s: For us to be less afraid of HIV? For us to have the kind of sex that we wanted to have?

	<!--03 DAMON JACOBS-->
						<h1> Damon Jacobs </h1>
						<p class="lead">
							Damon is a HIV educator and family therapist in New York City. His life changed four years ago when early reports from iPrEX showed that a new drug would be 92 percent effective at preventing HIV.
						</p>
						<p>
							“It was June 2011. I was in the 7th floor conference center of Gay Men’s Health Conference, GMHC at a large community forum where there would be more of the researchers and more science that was going to be presented about the further understanding of iPrEx following the initial understanding that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. What the further analysis revealed in the next 6 months after the initial results were published was the difference between the 44% number and the 92% number. So I was literally sitting there, in this room, and I believe Ken Mayer was the one who said that found in participants who took it consistently (meaning 4 or more times a week), that there was really 92 percent- I swear, I looked up and to me it was like did he… it was like a firework just went off. Like, did he really just say 92 percent? Could that be possible? For the first time in my adult life, could there be a way to prevent HIV that was that effective? Could there be a way that I could stay HIV-negative and enjoy my greater levels of intimacy and connection and sensuality with another person, which I had never known in my adult life without the fear of HIV? So yeah, that was a pretty big deal, and I was like, “I want this, I want to get my hands on it. “ And I wasn’t sure how, and I wasn’t sure if I could, but I gathered all the handouts that were being given out that day, and there wasn’t much. There wasn’t much on the internet on PrEp, but I went home, I found a couple of articles and a friend of mine who works in the field, who knew a little more about PrEP than I did, sorta led me through and gave me the courage to go to my doctor and have this conversation.
						</p>
						<p class="lead"> 
							On July 19, 2011, Damon started taking PrEP.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was kind of scary cause I didn’t know what the side effects could be, I didn’t know if I would feel - you know, Truvada is a medicine that’s used by HIV positive people, and it was approved for that in 2004, so it’s not like it was a new medicine, I wasn’t like you know worried my hair was going to fall out. But I didn’t know if I would have some of the more common side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, headaches. Would I be facing those, and if I did, would they be intolerable?...
						</p>
						<p>
							I had none of those side effects at any time. But honestly I thought this was a really interesting concept but I wasn’t quite so solid on how well it would work. The research was so new and the data was so new… but I also felt surprised that it also felt kind of empowering. It felt like every day that I take this blue pill that I was doing something proactive and responsible and empowering to prevent HIV. I mean it really felt like after all these years of living in fear that it would come to end because of this little blue pill.
						</p>
						<p class="lead"> 
							Damon initially kept his PrEP use private and focused his advocacy on vaccines and condoms.  It wasn’t until an encounter with an old friend that his perspective changed.
						</p>
						<p>
							When I was doing the vaccine research here in New York and teaching condoms only and vaccines only I actually got a lot of support from the drag community here and the drag community was very supportive of the research and finding an end to HIV. Some of the performers would even give me time on the stage.
						</p>
						<p>
							But in 2013 unfortunately the vaccine trials ended. There was no efficacy found at all. I lost my job. And the last week of my work I was really bummed about this. I was walking from my work on 7th Avenue in New York City and one of the drag queens who had shared the stage with me, in boy drag not in drag-drag, he came up to me and was like “Damon, how’s it going? How’s the research? What’s going on with that?” And I said to him, “Well it’s actually not going very well. Unfortunately the research trials are over…But at least until then we have PrEp.” And my friend said to me “well what’s PrEP?” and I said “Actually PrEP is this daily medication. It is over 92 percent effective. It is FDA approved. All the insurance companies are paying for it. I have now been on it for almost two years …It has just been a game changer for me and at least until we have a vaccine or a cure we have this.”
						</p>
						<p>
							And my friend just looked at me. His face…. He was like “Why didn’t you tell me?  I just became positive three months ago and I didn’t know there was a pill that could have prevented that and I didn’t know insurance would have paid for that pill. Why didn’t you tell me that?”
						</p>
						<p>
							And I’m telling you that was one of the worst moments for me, because here I am trying to be this do-gooder, educator, therapist activist, researcher guy and I had all this information about PrEP but I didn’t tell him about it because it wasn’t my job…But he was right. I had the knowledge and I had the information and I hadn’t shared it with him. And I got really upset after that and then I got really angry after that. I was like “Fuck it, that’s it. That’s the last time someone can legitimately call me on that.” That is why I started the group on Facebook and I am on there every day, literally, because I don’t want a single day to go by that I could be rightfully accused of not trying, not trying to get the word out. That was really the watershed moment for me.”
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							Today Damon runs the PrEP Fact: Rethinking HIV Prevention page on Facebook. With more than 6,000 members, it serves as a forum to ask questions, present problems and learn about the medication.

	<!--04 JIM PICKETT-->
						<h1> Jim Pickett </h1>
						<p class="lead">
							Jim has built a career on HIV prevention advocacy at the Aids Foundation of Chicago. He wants to create a “toolbox” of preventative technologies for the disease he has suffered from for nearly 20 years. The latest drug on his radar is PrEP. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I had been tracking new prevention technology research for well over a decade since the late 90s. Most of my focus, or a lot of my focus, has been around microbicides, so topical products that could be applied rectally or vaginally. And then somewhere in the early 2000s, PrEP came on my radar.
						</p>
						<p> 
							I looked at it very skeptically, like this was another way for pharma companies to have customers, and I was skeptical and I was cynical about it. I didn’t think much of it. It was before I understood what was really happening with prep research… When I started to educate myself, and learn more about the science, I don’t have a date when that started to happen but I’ve obviously been following research, so instead of just being cynical and kind of pissed off about this technology, I started to learn about it, and started to read about the science and the studies, and then I changed my opinion and I thought, “this is a really valid option and I hope it’s successful.” I don’t know when that happened but when it first came on my radar I didn’t just sort of stop with my knee-jerk reaction, I started to dig into it, learn more.
						</p>
						<p>
							I thought, “Well I should look into this and if I care about new prevention technologies, and I’m excited about microbicides, I shouldn’t be blinded by my love for the idea of microbicides.” All advocates should be focused on things that work. So whether they’re your pet things, your favorite things, the things you’ve really focused on, if something comes out of the pipeline that works, we have to get behind it…
						</p>
						<p class="lead"> 
							It has been challenging, you know, this is paradigm-shifting, this is upending almost 30 years of what we’ve talked about in terms of how to prevent HIV, 
						</p>
						<p>
							which has been, in terms of sexual acquisition, pretty much solely focused on condom use and other behavior change, but condoms being the central point. We’ve long used language like condoms are the gold standard of prevention, they’re our best thing…and so people’s conditioning, people’s beliefs were deeply challenged. People in the community, people who worked in the field, providers, everybody was deeply challenged by this.
						</p>
						<p>
							When for the longest time your notion of what safer sex is was wearing a condom, and now we’re saying, well, it’s wearing a condom but it could also be taking a pill, that’s huge. And it was i think bigger than any of us really expected… so that has taken some untangling. That’s untangling from every level. From policies and procedures, to community beliefs, to really challenging our comfort zone.
						</p>
						<p>
							We’ve done trainings and events where we have people who are very dead set against prep. Not so much anymore, but a couple years ago people who were very dead set against it did not want to hear anything about science. Their reaction was “No, no I dont want to hear about it. It’s bad,” and they had a million reasons for why it was bad.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’ve long been doing interviews about this and talking on programs and doing press and getting the word out and especially in the early years, a couple years ago, I would get sort of trolled. So people would start calling me names, start saying things: “Were you an expert 20 years ago when you became infected? Obviously not. What do you know?” And then they would say I’m shilling, that I’m just doing this to line Gilead’s pockets. They would look on AFC’s website and see that oh, lo and behold, Gilead is one of our funders… No one is shilling for anybody, we do work that we believe in. But anyhow, so then they would troll me on that, and then there were these ideas that “Well, me and people like me, positive people who have been pushing for prep, we’re only pushing for this because we have more people we can bareback with…So [they were saying] I’m doing this so I can have more people to have sex with without condoms, which is as kuku bananas as it gets. But that’s sort of what happens online anyhow. So, you can take it with a big grain of salt.
						</p>
						<p>
							Do we still have challenges? For sure. I think a lot of the enthusiasm is from early-adopter kind of people. But how do we get it to people who are vulnerable to HIV, but maybe don’t know about PrEP, or it’s just sort of on their radar but not a big interest, or they’re not sure about it… We gotta get to them. We need to build on this and sustain this. This isn’t just like, “yay, we’re done now, we have all kinds of peoples wearing t-shirts to pride.” There’s so much more, because that’s one piece of the puzzle. Awareness is one piece of the puzzle, but then helping people actually contemplate it, think about it, make a decision, get into care, have the things in place that they need to be able to access that care. It’s a big complicated thing.

	<!--05 HADEIS SAFI-->
						<h1> Hadeis Safi </h1>
						<p class="lead">
							Hadeis works with HIV testing at the Center on Halsted and bartends in Lakeview. He tested HIV positive three years ago after having unprotected sex several times, but did not see the virus as a death sentence. Instead, his upbeat, gregarious personality helped him accept his status and move on in life, albeit with slightly heavier baggage.  
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							November 29th, 2012, 6:30 pm. A week after Thanksgiving. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							I had just stopped dating somebody who I really liked. I was really hesitant to actually be physical with him. We dated for a very, very short period of time, but I knew. I knew I had seroconverted, I just hadn’t gotten the test yet. This guy and I had broken up a few days before. I Google’d nearby clinics. I walked in at 6 o’clock. It was dark, the sun was down already. I remember being like, “Okay, let’s go, this is it. No turning back now, I know what’s going to come of this, I know what’s going to happen. I just have to go now. I can’t wait anymore."
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							I went in, I sat down with the guy and I remember being like, “It’s going to come back positive, so let’s get on with it.”
						</p>
						<p>“Well, you don’t know that.”</p>
						<p>“No, no, I do. Let’s just do the thing.”</p>
						<p>
							I don’t know if he was new or if he was just nervous, but he was not really good at what he did. We sat down and he took the finger-prick.
						</p>
						<p> 
							We waited for 20 minutes. I remember being like, “Oh god, just hurry up. Get on with it. Let me get my results and move on with my day.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Twenty minutes pass by. “Alright, the test is done, so we’re going to take a look at it now.” He looks at the test and he pauses for a second and turns to me. “Oh right, I totally forgot – if it comes back positive, this is what we’re going to have to do next.”
						</p>
						<p>“Okay.”</p>
						<p class="lead">
							“Right, so, um –” he looks at the test again. I was like, ‘Go ahead and fucking say that it’s positive so we can move on.’
						</p>
						<p>
							“So your test came back positive…”
						</p>
						<p>
							And I was like, “Cool. Can I go now?” I didn’t want to be there. I knew – I had known for probably over a year at that point, I had known I had seroconverted. But I finally heard it and I wanted to go and be alone.
						</p>
						<p>
							The director of the program was there, so he came in and talked to me. “How are you? How are you doing?”
						</p>
						<p>
							“Well, I have HIV, so…I’m as okay as can be. Can I go smoke now? I just want to have a cigarette.” That’s all I wanted to do.
						</p>
						<p>
							They were going over the procedural stuff they had to do, and I understood that and I let them do their thing, but the entire time I remember being like, “Can I go smoke now? Can I go smoke now? Are we done yet?”
						</p>
						<p>
							They did the final finger-prick test and took my blood. It was 7:30 at night, almost 8 o’clock, and I remember they were finally like, “Okay we’re going to call you two weeks from now when the confirmatory tests come back.”
						</p>
						<p>
							“Okay, can I go smoke now?”
						</p>
						<p>
							They said fine, so I went to my car and pulled out my cigarette. I grabbed my phone, I was like, “Do I call...?” I always had people I was close to, but I was like, “I can’t do that to them right now. It’s a month before Christmas. I don’t give a flying fuck about Christmas, but it’s a big, happy holiday for them. Alright, I’ll leave this alone.”
						</p>
						<p>
							So I went home and lost myself in the Internet. I started playing on Twitter and watching music videos and doing anything to keep my mind off of it. Nothing was successful, but I remember trying not to think about it because I couldn’t talk to anybody about it yet. I wasn’t ready to make somebody else deal with that kind of knowledge. I was very alone in the process.
						</p>
						<p>
							I had a couple breakdowns a few weeks later. Some guy randomly attacked me on Twitter. The man said Hadeis’s friend had HIV and that he was a whore. I interjected, saying, “Don’t go around saying shit like that.” I remember going in to defend my friend and that guy posted that I had AIDS. At that point I had just found out three weeks before and I lost it. I remember texting my friend who that was happening with, and I was like, “I need to talk to you right now because this is too much for me.”
						</p>
						<p>
							That was the first time I said it to somebody else. It was intense for me. 
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							Hadeis describes himself as “HIV-positive-positive.” He does not allow his status to jeopardize his personality or sense of humor. For him, cracking jokes is the best way to manage his status.
						</p>
						<p>
							I met a friend’s boyfriend a month ago. It was a whole bunch of us and the first time we were meeting our friend’s new boyfriend. The host of the party we were at mentioned being on PrEP and made a joke like, “Oh, I have some PrEP in my bag if you need it.” 
						</p>
						<p>
							“Oh y’all talking about PrEP? I have some in my bag too, except I call it ‘too late.’”
						</p>
						<p>
							Everybody laughs, except for new boyfriend whose jaw just drops and is like, “Oh my god this guy is horrible! That’s a terrible joke to make!” I was like, “Ah sorry, you just don’t know me. You didn’t know things about me and I make these jokes often.”
						</p>
						<p>
							It’s something I do with all my identities. I make a lot of “I’m gay” jokes. I poke fun at all different parts of my identities because there’s no point in taking myself too seriously. That’s just my mindset. If I’m going to manage it, I’m going to manage it in my way. 
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							Hadeis has not told his parents about his status yet but has received a tremendous amount of support from his friends. But, with HIV comes a lot of different reactions, ranging from stigma to fetishization. A couple years ago, Hadeis encountered a bug-chaser: someone who intentionally tries to contract HIV and other STIs. 
						</p>
						<p>
							There was a person who I had that conversation [about being HIV+] with. He was like, “Okay, cool, same.” This guy and I ended up having sex and a month and a half later, he goes, “Oh by the way, I definitely got [HIV] from you!”
						</p>
						<p>
							“What?”
						</p>
						
						<p class="lead">
							“Yeah, I lied, I was negative. I was trying to get HIV so I told you I was positive so you would fuck me.”
						</p>
						<p>
							“Are you fucking kidding me?! I wouldn’t have done that had I known that this was not already a reality for you.”
						</p>

						<p>
							I was really angry and really upset. He put me in this really uncomfortable position where I almost passed on this virus to somebody without my consent. The possibility of me having done that already is there because I was not on treatment for a while, but this guy straight-up lied to me about his serostatus and used me, literally used me, to convert himself. 
						</p>
						<p>
							That was a really fucking weird experience. There’s nothing I could have done more in that situation. According to him, I gave someone else HIV. Holy fucking shit. He could just be lying. He could be fucking with me. He’s never come back and sue me or press assault charges; he was super excited. Whether I gave it to him or he actually got it himself, I don’t know. I haven’t talked to him since the day he sent me that message.

	<!--06 PHIL CORDES-->
						<h1> Phil Cordes </h1>
						<p class="lead">
							Phil Cordes is a 27-year-old gay man who grew up in a conservative, religious family in Ohio. He is negative but has been exposed to HIV firsthand. His experiences have shaped his consciousness of HIV/ AIDS and believes it needs to be an open conversation in safe spaces today.   
						</p>
						<p>
							It was all something that was other. People with HIV were other. I didn’t know anyone who was HIV positive, I didn’t know any stories, I didn’t know anything. And then after I graduated college this is where I first had my exposure to people who were positive. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							I went to South Africa for a year and I was working with refugee clients at a nonprofit in Durbin, South Africa and it was there I had men, women, one gay client in the entire year from Uganda, who was fleeing persecution that was happening to LGBTQ folks in Uganda, but I had a lot of mothers and even children who were HIV positive because there’s a 40 percent infection rate in South Africa. Typically among people who are disadvantaged like refugees it’s probably even higher, there’s so much transitory nature to their lives. 
						</p>
						<p> So that’s when I had my first kind of exposure to that. </p>
						<p class="lead">
							Growing up, Phil had suspicions about his older brother who was gay and lived in New York City. Phil had an instinct that his brother was positive, but had not discussed it with him. South Africa was the first moment of major openness for Phil.
						</p>
						<p>I was in South Africa where it’s something that is dealt with very poignantly and we had an AIDS celebration on December 1, when I was there for our organization. </p>
						<p class="lead">
							Two months ago Phil sat down with his brother and brought up the question of his status. 
						</p>
						<p>
							So I was visiting my family in Ohio and it was a suspicion I had held, I’ve wondered, so he and I had this long chat over coffee about a multitude of other things and at the end I said to him, “I have to be very sensitive in how I ask this question, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about and I wondered. I don’t want to approach you in a way I’m making assumptions about who you are, but could you clarify for me what your status is in regards to HIV?”
						</p>
						<p>
							And he thought for a second and he goes, “Well, I am positive.” 
						</p>
						<p>
							He said, “I’ve been talking to my friend and I’ve wanted to tell you for a while but I also didn’t want to throw that on you.”
						</p>
						<p>
							It was a great conversation and really sharing vulnerably, and it told me about the relationship he was in when this happened and he gave me older brother wisdom.
						</p>
						<p>
							I said, “I don’t think anything differently of you and I’m really glad you shared.”
						</p>
						<p>
							I think it was important for me to say I don’t see you as any different. I think, also, he thought about telling me when I first came out several years ago, and I think he would have shared that with me. Then I would have held a lot of the same cultural stereotypes that I had from my upbringing. He’s not even sure he’ll share with my sister, he eventually will, he promised he eventually would, but he will never share with my parents. It’s just something he’s not going to broach a conversation about because it just won’t be good. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Number one, he doesn’t want concern, he doesn’t want pity. He also doesn’t want to be told “We told you so” and based off my parent’s assumptions of what it means to be gay, it’s a sin and it’s wrong and it isn’t healthy, so it kind of proves their point. They almost see HIV as a kind of punishment in a way, so it kind of reinforces a lot of the stereotypes they are holding onto. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I think he doesn’t want to share because of that and he also kind of has his own places of shame and insecurity that he carries with him. We all do that. And part of that is knowing who are safe people to share things with and where do you make an effort to be vulnerable and where do you say “Even if I try to be vulnerable and even if I am honest with this person, they’re not going to receive it.”  It’s like trying to talk to someone who’s deaf and blind. They just, it’s not possible unless you have the ability to connect with them and the modes of communication they can access. For people who are like my parents, of the Baby Boomer generation they just, they don’t know how to connect to that in a conversation.
						</p>
						<p class="lead"> 
							A few weeks ago, Phil was tested for the first time. He had been in a long-term relationship and was not nervous about his status but got tested to practice healthy regular check ups. He told his friends about his experience, but was met with shock at his candidness. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							I don’t think it’s something that’s in the consciousness of people in my age group to be honest. I had a two year relationship that just ended back in February and that was my only sexual partner I’ve ever had and when I had this conversation with my brother just a short while ago actually he made me make a promise to him that I would get tested every 3 to 4 months, almost regardless, just to make it a healthy practice going forward in my life, no matter what.  
						</p>
						<p> 
							And so, I went and got tested for the very first time a week ago and I wasn’t worried at all and everything was clear to go but what was interesting, I went to an event that evening, its called “The Welcome Committee,” it’s a group of LGBTQ folks who get together and they try to make safe spaces for gay and lesbian people to meet.
						</p>
						<p> 
							So we were at a bar in the West Loop, I shared with them the fact that I had gotten tested and my friend Kevin turned to me and he says, “Phil, that’s really amazing that you have the ability to declare that to people because not many people are willing to share the fact that they were tested.” 
						</p>
						<p class="lead"> 
							These are things we have to be able to talk about and bring into our consciousness.
						</p>
